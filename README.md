# 👋 Hi, I'm Braunder

### 💻 Backend Developer | Machine Learning | AI Integrator

🚀 **Turning Algorithms into Useful Bots**
I develop and train AI assistants that solve everyday tasks - from automating routine to smart data analysis.
My goal is to create not just code, but **intelligent digital assistants** with character.

## 🔧 **Technologies and stack**
- **Languages:** Python, SQL
- **Machine learning:** TensorFlow/PyTorch, NLP, LLM (GPT, Llama, etc.)
- **Backend:** FastAPI, Django, AsyncIO
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, Redis, Vector DBs (for embeddings)
- **DevOps & Deployment:** Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
- **Integrations:** Telegram/Discord API, RPA (process automation)

## 🚀 **My projects**
- 🤖 **AI assistant with character** is a personal assistant that not only answers questions, but also learns to adapt to the user.
- 🧠 **Automation of ML pipelines** – from data collection to model deployment.
- 🔍 **AI for habit analysis** – helps optimize time and productivity.

## 🎯 **Goals**
- Develop in the field of **artificial intelligence and generative models**.
- Work on cool projects in a **large tech company** or **startup**.
- Create **open-source tools** for AI developers.

## ☕ **Facts about me**
- 🔍 **I love understanding neural networks** – I can spend hours studying the architectures of new models.
- 🦥 **Lazy in routine** – so I automate everything that is possible (and not possible).
- 🤖 **I believe** that AI should not only be smart, but also **interesting to talk to**.

📫 **Connection:** *(Under development)*
